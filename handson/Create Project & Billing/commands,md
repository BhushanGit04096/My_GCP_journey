# Create Project & Billing – GCP Commands

Login to Google Cloud CLI:

gcloud auth login

Verify authenticated account:
gcloud auth list

Set the newly created project as the active project:
gcloud config set project gcp-handson-project

Verify the active project:
gcloud config get-value project

List all projects available to the account to confirm project creation:
gcloud projects list

List all available billing accounts:
gcloud billing accounts list

Check whether billing is enabled for the project:
gcloud billing projects describe gcp-handson-project
  
Expected output should show:
billingEnabled: true

If billing is not linked, link the billing account manually (requires Billing Admin role):
gcloud billing projects link gcp-handson-project --billing-account=XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX


Run a compute command to confirm billing and API access:
gcloud compute regions list
