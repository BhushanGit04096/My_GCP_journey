# Identity & Access Management (IAM)

This section covers **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** in Google Cloud Platform.
IAM controls **who can do what on which resource**.

In this hands-on, we focus on:
- Using **predefined IAM roles**
- Creating and using **service accounts**
- Binding IAM roles at the **project level**

This is a **core Cloud Engineer skill** and heavily tested in interviews.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand IAM components in GCP
- Assign predefined roles to users
- Create and manage service accounts
- Bind IAM roles at the project level
- Validate access using permissions

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Principal**: Who (user, service account, group)
- **Role**: What permissions are granted
- **Resource**: Where access applies (project, folder, org)

---

## 📌 Scope (Intentional)

✔ Predefined roles  
✔ Service accounts  
✔ Project-level IAM bindings  

❌ Custom roles  
❌ Organization / Folder IAM  
❌ IAM Conditions  

(These are advanced and not required for your current phase.)

## ✅ Outcome

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Securely grant access using IAM
- Use service accounts for GCP services
- Explain IAM clearly in interviews
